\( +\quad-\quad+ \) \\
2.1 Introduction
In Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall that if \( p(x) \) is a polynomial in \( x \), the highest power of \( x \) in \( p(x) \) is called the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \). For example, \( 4 x+2 \) is a polynomial in the variable \( x \) of degree \( 1,2 y^{2}-3 y+4 \) is a polynomial in the variable \( y \) of degree \( 2,5 x^{3}-4 x^{2}+x-\sqrt{2} \)
is a polynomial in the variable \( x \) of degree 3 and \( 7 u^{6}-\frac{3}{2} u^{4}+4 u^{2}+u-8 \) is a polynomial
in the variable \( u \) of degree 6. Expressions like \( \frac{1}{x-1}, \sqrt{x}+2, \frac{1}{x^{2}+2 x+3} \) etc., are not polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example, \( 2 x-3 \), \( \sqrt{3} x+5, y+\sqrt{2}, x-\frac{2}{11}, 3 z+4, \frac{2}{3} u+1 \), etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as \( 2 x+5-x^{2}, x^{3}+1 \), etc., are not linear polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name 'quadratic'
has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means 'square'. \( 2 x^{2}+3 x-\frac{2}{5} \),
\( y^{2}-2,2-x^{2}+\sqrt{3} x, \frac{u}{3}-2 u^{2}+5, \sqrt{5} v^{2}-\frac{2}{3} v, 4 z^{2}+\frac{1}{7} \) are some examples of
quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in \( x \) is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c \), where \( a, b, c \) are real numbers and \( a \neq 0 \). A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of
2020-21 POLYNOMIALS
a cubic polynomial are \( 2-x^{3}, x^{3}, \sqrt{2} x^{3}, 3-x^{2}+x^{3}, 3 x^{3}-2 x^{2}+x-1 \). In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is
\[
a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d
\]
where, \( a, b, c, d \) are real numbers and \( a \neq 0 \). Now consider the polynomial \( p(x)=x^{2}-3 x-4 . \) Then, putting \( x=2 \) in the polynomial, we get \( p(2)=2^{2}-3 \times 2-4=-6 \). The value ' \( -6 \) ', obtained by replacing \( x \) by 2 in \( x^{2}-3 x-4 \), is the value of \( x^{2}-3 x-4 \) at \( x=2 \). Similarly, \( p(0) \) is the value of \( p(x) \) at \( x=0 \), which is \( -4 \).

If \( p(x) \) is a polynomial in \( x \), and if \( k \) is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing \( x \) by \( k \) in \( p(x) \), is called the value of \( p(x) \) at \( x=k \), and is denoted by \( p(k) \). What is the value of \( p(x)=x^{2}-3 x-4 \) at \( x=-1 \) ? We have :
\[
p(-1)=(-1)^{2}-\{3 \times(-1)\}-4=0
\]
Also, note that \( \quad p(4)=4^{2}-(3 \times 4)-4=0 \).
As \( p(-1)=0 \) and \( p(4)=0,-1 \) and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial \( x^{2}-3 x-4 \). More generally, a real number \( k \) is said to be a zero of a polynomial \( \boldsymbol{p}(\boldsymbol{x}) \), if \( p(k)=0 \).

You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if \( k \) is a zero of \( p(x)=2 x+3 \), then \( p(k)=0 \) gives us
\[
2 k+3=0 \text { , i.e., } k=-\frac{3}{2} \text { . }
\]
In general, if \( k \) is a zero of \( p(x)=a x+b \), then \( p(k)=a k+b=0 \), i.e., \( k=\frac{-b}{a} \). So, the zero of the linear polynomial \( a x+b \) is \( \frac{-b}{a}=\frac{-(\text { Constant term })}{\text { Coefficient of } x} \).

Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients?

In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials.
2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial
You know that a real number \( k \) is a zero of the polynomial \( p(x) \) if \( p(k)=0 \). But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes.
2020-21 22
MATHEMATICS
Consider first a linear polynomial \( a x+b, a \neq 0 \). You have studied in Class IX that the graph of \( y=a x+b \) is a straight line. For example, the graph of \( y=2 x+3 \) is a straight line passing through the points \( (-2,-1) \) and \( (2,7) \).
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( -2 \) & 2 \\
\hline\( y=2 x+3 \) & \( -1 \) & 7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
From Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of \( y=2 x+3 \) intersects the \( x \) -axis mid-way between \( x=-1 \) and
that is, at the point \( \left(-\frac{3}{2}, 0\right) \).
You also know that the zero of
\( 2 x+3 \) is \( -\frac{3}{2} \). Thus, the zero of the polynomial \( 2 x+3 \) is the \( x \) -coordinate of the point where the graph of \( y=2 x+3 \) intersects the Fig.
\( x \) -axis.
In general, for a linear polynomial \( a x+b, a \neq 0 \), the graph of \( y=a x+b \) is a
straight line which intersects the \( x \) -axis at exactly one point, namely, \( \left(\frac{-b}{a}, 0\right) \).
Therefore, the linear polynomial \( a x+b, a \neq 0 \), has exactly one zero, namely, the \( x \) -coordinate of the point where the graph of \( y=a x+b \) intersects the \( x \) -axis.

Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial \( x^{2}-3 x-4 \). Let us see what the graph* of \( y=x^{2}-3 x-4 \) looks like. Let us list a few values of \( y=x^{2}-3 x-4 \) corresponding to a few values for \( x \) as given in Table \( 2.1 \).

Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students, nor is to be evaluated.
\( 2020-21 \) \( \mathbf{2 . 1} \)
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline\( x \) & \( -2 \) & \( -1 \) & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline\( y=x^{2}-3 x-4 \) & 6 & 0 & \( -4 \) & \( -6 \) & \( -6 \) & \( -4 \) & 0 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
If we locate the points listed
the points where the graph of \( y=x^{2}-3 x-4 \) intersects
the \( x \) -axis.
This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial \( a x^{2}+b x+c, a \neq 0 \), are precisely the \( x \) -coordinates of the points where the parabola representing \( y=a x^{2}+b x+c \) intersects the \( x \) -axis.

From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of \( y=a x^{2}+b x+c \), the following three cases can happen:
2020-21 24
МАТнЕ
Case (i) : Here, the graph cuts \( x \) -axis at two distinct points A and A'.
The \( x \) -coordinates of \( \mathrm{A} \) and \( \mathrm{A}^{\prime} \) are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial \( a x^{2}+b x+c \) in this case (see Fig. 2.3).
\( \mathbf{2 . 3} \)
Case (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the \( x \) -axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and \( A^{\prime} \) of Case (i) coincide here to become one point \( A \) (see Fig. 2.4).
(i)
(ii)
Fig. \( 2.4 \)
The \( x \) -coordinate of \( \mathrm{A} \) is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial \( a x^{2}+b x+c \) in this case.
2020-21 PoLYNOMIALS
Case (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the \( x \) -axis or completely below the \( x \) -axis. So, it does not cut the \( x \) -axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).
(i)
(ii)
Fig. \( 2.5 \)
So, the quadratic polynomial \( a x^{2}+b x+c \) has no zero in this case.
So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.

Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial \( x^{3}-4 x \). To see what the graph of \( y=x^{3}-4 x \) looks like, let us list a few values of \( y \) corresponding to a few values for \( x \) as shown in Table \( 2.2 \).
Table \( 2.2 \)
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline\( x \) & \( -2 \) & \( -1 \) & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline\( y=x^{3}-4 x \) & 0 & 3 & 0 & \( -3 \) & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
Locating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see that the graph of \( y=x^{3}-4 x \) actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.
2020-21 We see from the table above
0 and 2 are zeroes of the
cubic polynomial \( x^{3}-4 x \). Observe
that \( -2,0 \) and 2 are, in fact, the
\( x \) -coordinates of the only points graph of \( y=x^{3}-4 x \)
\( x \) -axis. Since the curve eets the \( x \) -axis in only these 3
points, their \( x \) -coordinates are the only zeroes of the polynomial.
Let us take a few more
examples. Consider the cubic polynomials \( x^{3} \) and \( x^{3}-x^{2} \). We draw the graphs of \( y=x^{3} \) and \( y=x^{3}-x^{2} \) in Fig. \( 2.7 \) and Fig. \( 2.8 \) respectively. Fig. \( 2.6 \)
\( \begin{array}{ll}\text { Fig. 2.7 } & \text { Fig. } 2.8\end{array} \)
2020-2 POLYNOMIALS 27
Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial \( x^{3} \). Also, from Fig. \( 2.7 \), you can see that 0 is the \( x \) -coordinate of the only point where the graph of \( y=x^{3} \) intersects the \( x \) -axis. Similarly, since \( x^{3}-x^{2}=x^{2}(x-1), 0 \) and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial \( x^{3}-x^{2} . \) Also, from Fig. \( 2.8 \), these values are the \( x \) -coordinates of the only points where the graph of \( y=x^{3}-x^{2} \) intersects the \( x \) -axis.

From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.
Remark : In general, given a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree \( n \), the graph of \( y=p(x) \) intersects the \( x \) -axis at atmost \( n \) points. Therefore, a polynomial \( p(x) \) of degree \( n \) has at most \( n \) zeroes.

Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig. \( 2.9 \) given below. Each is the graph of \( y=p(x) \), where \( p(x) \) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of \( p(x) \).

2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial \( a x+b \) is \( -\frac{b}{a} \). We will now try to answer the question raised in Section \( 2.1 \) regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, say \( p(x)=2 x^{2}-8 x+6 \). In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term \( '-8 x^{\prime} \) as a sum of two terms, whose product is \( 6 \times 2 x^{2}=12 x^{2} . \) So, we write
\( 2 x^{2}-8 x+6=2 x^{2}-6 x-2 x+6=2 x(x-3)-2(x-3) \)
\[
=(2 x-2)(x-3)=2(x-1)(x-3)
\]
\( 2020-21 \) POLYNOMIALS
So, the value of \( p(x)=2 x^{2}-8 x+6 \) is zero when \( x-1=0 \) or \( x-3=0 \), i.e., when \( x=1 \) or \( x=3 \). So, the zeroes of \( 2 x^{2}-8 x+6 \) are 1 and 3 . Observe that :
\[
\text { Sum of its zeroes }=1+3=4=\frac{-(-8)}{2}=\frac{-(\text { Coefficient of } x)}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}}
\]
Product of its zeroes \( =1 \times 3=3=\frac{6}{2}=\frac{\text { Constant term }}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}} \)
Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, \( p(x)=3 x^{2}+5 x-2 \). By the method of splitting the middle term,
\[
\begin{aligned}
3 x^{2}+5 x-2 &=3 x^{2}+6 x-x-2=3 x(x+2)-1(x+2) \\
&=(3 x-1)(x+2)
\end{aligned}
\]
Hence, the value of \( 3 x^{2}+5 x-2 \) is zero when either \( 3 x-1=0 \) or \( x+2=0 \), i.e. when \( x=\frac{1}{3} \) or \( x=-2 \). So, the zeroes of \( 3 x^{2}+5 x-2 \) are \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( -2 \). Observe that :
\[
\text { Sum of its zeroes }=\frac{1}{3}+(-2)=\frac{-5}{3}=\frac{-(\text { Coefficient of } x)}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}}
\]
Product of its zeroes \( =\frac{1}{3} \times(-2)=\frac{-2}{3}=\frac{\text { Constant term }}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}} \)
In general, if \( \alpha \) and \( \beta^{*} \) are the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial \( p(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c \), \( a \neq 0 \), then you know that \( x-\alpha \) and \( x-\beta \) are the factors of \( p(x) \). Therefore, \( a x^{2}+b x+c=k(x-\alpha)(x-\beta) \), where \( k \) is a constant
\[
\begin{array}{l}
=k\left[x^{2}-(\alpha+\beta) x+\alpha \beta\right] \\
=k x^{2}-k(\alpha+\beta) x+k \alpha \beta
\end{array}
\]
Comparing the coefficients of \( x^{2}, x \) and constant terms on both the sides, we get
This gives
\[
\begin{aligned}
a=k, b &=-k(\alpha+\beta) \text { and } c=k \alpha \beta . \\
\alpha+\beta &=\frac{-b}{a}
\end{aligned}
\]
\[
\alpha \beta=\frac{c}{a}
\]
\( \alpha, \beta \) are Greek letters pronounced as 'alpha' and 'beta' respectively. We will use later one more letter ' \( \gamma \) ' pronounced as 'gamma'.
2020-21 30
MATHEMATIC
i.e.,
\[
\text { sum of zeroes }=\alpha+\beta=-\frac{b}{a}=\frac{-(\text { Coefficient of } x)}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}}
\]
product of zeroes \( =\alpha \beta=\frac{c}{a}=\frac{\text { Constant term }}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}} \).
Let us consider some examples.
Example \( 2: \) Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial \( x^{2}+7 x+10 \), and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients. Solution : We have
\[
x^{2}+7 x+10=(x+2)(x+5)
\]
So, the value of \( x^{2}+7 x+10 \) is zero when \( x+2=0 \) or \( x+5=0 \), i.e., when \( x=-2 \) or \( x=-5 \). Therefore, the zeroes of \( x^{2}+7 x+10 \) are \( -2 \) and \( -5 \). Now,
\[
\text { sum of zeroes }=-2+(-5)=-(7)=\frac{-(7)}{1}=\frac{-(\text { Coefficient of } x)}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}}
\]
product of zeroes \( =(-2) \times(-5)=10=\frac{10}{1}=\frac{\text { Constant term }}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}} \).
Example 3 : Find the zeroes of the polynomial \( x^{2}-3 \) and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients. Solution : Recall the identity \( a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b) \). Using it, we can write:
\[
x^{2}-3=(x-\sqrt{3})(x+\sqrt{3})
\]
So, the value of \( x^{2}-3 \) is zero when \( x=\sqrt{3} \) or \( x=-\sqrt{3} \).
Therefore, the zeroes of \( x^{2}-3 \) are \( \sqrt{3} \) and \( -\sqrt{3} \).
Now,
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\text { sum of zeroes }=\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{3}=0=\frac{-(\text { Coefficient of } x)}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}} \\
\text { product of zeroes }=(\sqrt{3})(-\sqrt{3})=-3=\frac{-3}{1}=\frac{\text { Constant term }}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}} \\
2020-21
\end{array}
\] POLYNOMIALS
Example 4 : Find a quadratic polynomial, the sum and product of whose zeroes are \( -3 \) and 2, respectively. Solution : Let the quadratic polynomial be \( a x^{2}+b x+c \), and its zeroes be \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \). We have
and
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\alpha+\beta=-3=\frac{-b}{a}, \\
\alpha \beta=2=\frac{c}{a}
\end{array}
\]
If \( a=1 \), then \( b=3 \) and \( c=2 \).
So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is \( x^{2}+3 x+2 \).
You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will be of the form \( k\left(x^{2}+3 x+2\right) \), where \( k \) is real.

Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds between the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients? Let us consider \( p(x)=2 x^{3}-5 x^{2}-14 x+8 \). You can check that \( p(x)=0 \) for \( x=4,-2, \frac{1}{2} \). Since \( p(x) \) can have atmost three zeroes, these are the zeores of \( 2 x^{3}-5 x^{2}-14 x+8 \). Now,
\[
\text { sum of the zeroes }=4+(-2)+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{2}=\frac{-(-5)}{2}=\frac{-\left(\text { Coefficient of } x^{2}\right)}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{3}}
\]
product of the zeroes \( =4 \times(-2) \times \frac{1}{2}=-4=\frac{-8}{2}=\frac{-\text { Constant term }}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{3}} \).
However, there is one more relationship here. Consider the sum of the products of the zeroes taken two at a time. We have
\[
\begin{aligned}
\{4 \times(-2)\}+\left\{(-2) \times \frac{1}{2}\right\}+\left\{\frac{1}{2} \times 4\right\} & \\
=&-8-1+2=-7=\frac{-14}{2}=\frac{\text { Coefficient of } x}{\text { Coefficient of } x^{3}} .
\end{aligned}
\]
In general, it can be proved that if \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial \( a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d \), then
2020-21 32
MATHEMAT
\[
\begin{aligned}
\alpha+\beta+\gamma &=\frac{-b}{a} \\
\alpha \beta+\beta \gamma+\gamma \alpha &=\frac{c}{a} \\
\alpha \beta \gamma &=\frac{-d}{a} .
\end{aligned}
\]
Let us consider an example.
Example \( 5^{*} \) : Verify that \( 3,-1,-\frac{1}{3} \) are the zeroes of the cubic polynomial \( p(x)=3 x^{3}-5 x^{2}-11 x-3 \), and then verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.
Solution : Comparing the given polynomial with \( a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d \), we get
\[
\begin{array}{l}
a=3, b=-5, c=-11, d=-3 . \text { Further } \\
p(3)=3 \times 3^{3}-\left(5 \times 3^{2}\right)-(11 \times 3)-3=81-45-33-3=0, \\
p(-1)=3 \times(-1)^{3}-5 \times(-1)^{2}-11 \times(-1)-3=-3-5+11-3=0, \\
p\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=3 \times\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^{3}-5 \times\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2}-11 \times\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)-3, \\
=-\frac{1}{9}-\frac{5}{9}+\frac{11}{3}-3=-\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}=0
\end{array}
\]
Therefore, \( 3,-1 \) and \( -\frac{1}{3} \) are the zeroes of \( 3 x^{3}-5 x^{2}-11 x-3 \). So, we take \( \alpha=3, \beta=-1 \) and \( \gamma=-\frac{1}{3} \). Now,
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\alpha+\beta+\gamma=3+(-1)+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=2-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{3}=\frac{-(-5)}{3}=\frac{-b}{a}, \\
\alpha \beta+\beta \gamma+\gamma \alpha=3 \times(-1)+(-1) \times\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) \times 3=-3+\frac{1}{3}-1=\frac{-11}{3}=\frac{c}{a}, \\
\alpha \beta \gamma=3 \times(-1) \times\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=1=\frac{-(-3)}{3}=\frac{-d}{a}
\end{array}
\]
Not from the examination point of view.

2.4 Division Algorithm for Polynomials You know that a cubic polynomial has at most three zeroes. However, if you are given only one zero, can you find the other two? For this, let us consider the cubic polynomial \( x^{3}-3 x^{2}-x+3 \). If we tell you that one of its zeroes is 1 , then you know that \( x-1 \) is a factor of \( x^{3}-3 x^{2}-x+3 \). So, you can divide \( x^{3}-3 x^{2}-x+3 \) by \( x-1 \), as you have learnt in Class IX, to get the quotient \( x^{2}-2 x-3 \).

Next, you could get the factors of \( x^{2}-2 x-3 \), by splitting the middle term, as \( (x+1)(x-3) \). This would give you
\[
\begin{aligned}
x^{3}-3 x^{2}-x+3 &=(x-1)\left(x^{2}-2 x-3\right) \\
&=(x-1)(x+1)(x-3)
\end{aligned}
\]
So, all the three zeroes of the cubic polynomial are now known to you as \( 1,-1,3 . \)
Let us discuss the method of dividing one polynomial by another in some detail. Before noting the steps formally, consider an example.
Example 6 : Divide \( 2 x^{2}+3 x+1 \) by \( x+2 \).
\[
x + 2 \longdiv { 2 x ^ { 2 } + 3 x + 1 }
\]
Solution : Note that we stop the division process when either the remainder is zero or its degree is less than the
\[
\frac{2 x^{2} \pm 4 x}{-x+1}
\]
degree of the divisor. So, here the quotient is \( 2 x-1 \) and the remainder is 3 . Also, \( (2 x-1)(x+2)+3=2 x^{2}+3 x-2+3=2 x^{2}+3 x+1 \)
\[
\frac{-x-2}{+} \frac{3}{3}
\]
i.e., \( \quad 2 x^{2}+3 x+1=(x+2)(2 x-1)+3 \)
Therefore, Dividend = Divisor \( \times \) Quotient + Remainder
Let us now extend this process to divide a polynomial by a quadratic polynomial.

МАтнв
Example 7 : Divide \( 3 x^{3}+x^{2}+2 x+5 \) by \( 1+2 x+x^{2} \).
Solution : We first arrange the terms of dividend and the divisor in the decreasing order of their degrees. Recall that arranging the terms in this order is called writing the polynomials standard form. In this example, the dividend already in standard form, and the divisor, standard form, is \( x^{2}+2 x+1 \).
Step 1 : To obtain the first term of the quotient, divide the highest degree term of the dividend (i.e., \( 3 x^{3} \) ) by the highest degree term of the divisor (i.e., \( x^{2} \) ). This is \( 3 x \). Then carry out the division process. What remains is \( -5 x^{2}-x+5 \).

Step 2 : Now, to obtain the second term of the quotient, divide the highest degree term of the new dividend (i.e., \( -5 x^{2} \) ) by the highest degree term of the divisor (i.e., \( x^{2} \) ). This gives \( -5 \). Again carry out the division process with \( -5 x^{2}-x+5 \).

Step 3 : What remains is \( 9 x+10 \). Now, the degree of \( 9 x+10 \) is less than the degree of the divisor \( x^{2}+2 x+1 \). So, we cannot continue the division any further.
So, the quotient is \( 3 x-5 \) and the remainder is \( 9 x+10 \). Also,
\[
\begin{aligned}
\left(x^{2}+2 x+1\right) \times(3 x-5)+(9 x+10) &=3 x^{3}+6 x^{2}+3 x-5 x^{2}-10 x-5+9 x+10 \\
&=3 x^{3}+x^{2}+2 x+5
\end{aligned}
\]
Here again, we see that Dividend \( = \) Divisor \( \times \) Quotient \( + \) Remainder
What we are applying here is an algorithm which is similar to Euclid's division algorithm that you studied in Chapter 1 .
This says that
If \( p(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are any two polynomials with \( g(x) \neq 0 \), then we can find polynomials \( q(x) \) and \( r(x) \) such that
\[
p(x)=g(x) \times q(x)+r(x)
\]
where \( r(x)=0 \) or degree of \( r(x)< \) degree of \( g(x) \).
This result is known as the Division Algorithm for polynomials.
Let us now take some examples to illustrate its use.
Example 8 : Divide \( 3 x^{2}-x^{3}-3 x+5 \) by \( x-1-x^{2} \), and verify the division algorithm.
\[

\( - x ^ { 2 } + x - 1 \longdiv { - x ^ { 3 } + 3 x ^ { 2 } - 3 x + 5 } \) \\
\( -x^{3}+x^{2}-x \) \\
\( +\quad-\quad+ \) \\
\hline \( 2 x^{2}-2 x+5 \) \\

\( \frac{-}{3}+\frac{-}{3} \)
\end{tabular} To carry
he dividend and
of their degrees.
\[
+5 \text { and }
\]
We stop \( (3)=0<2= \) degree \( \left(-x^{2}+x-1\right) \)
So, quotient \( =x-2 \), remainder \( =3 \).
Now,
Divisor \( \times \) Quotient + Remainder
\[
\begin{array}{l}
=\left(-x^{2}+x-1\right)(x-2)+3 \\
=-x^{3}+x^{2}-x+2 x^{2}-2 x+2+3 \\
=-x^{3}+3 x^{2}-3 x+5
\end{array}
\]
\( = \) Dividend
In this way, the division algorithm is verified.
Example \( 9: \) Find all the zeroes of \( 2 x^{4}-3 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+6 x-2 \), if you know that two of its zeroes are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2} \).

Solution: Since two zeroes are \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( -\sqrt{2},(x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})=x^{2}-2 \) is
factor of the given polynomial. Now, we divide the given polynomial by \( x^{2}-2 \).

So, \( 2 x^{4}-3 x^{3}-3 x^{2}+6 x-2=\left(x^{2}-2\right)\left(2 x^{2}-3 x+1\right) \).
Now, by splitting \( -3 x \), we factorise \( 2 x^{2}-3 x+1 \) as \( (2 x-1)(x-1) \). So, its zeroes are given by \( x=\frac{1}{2} \) and \( x=1 \). Therefore, the zeroes of the given polynomial are \( \sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}, \frac{1}{2} \), and 1

4.1 Introduction
In Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the quadratic polynomial of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c, a \neq 0 \). When we equate this polynomial to zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with many real-life situations. For instance, suppose a charity trust decides to build a prayer hall having a carpet area of 300 square metres with its length one metre more than twice its breadth. What should be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is \( x \) metres. Then, \( \quad 2 x+1 \) its length should be \( (2 x+1) \) metres. We can depict this information pictorially as shown in Fig. \( 4.1 \). Fig. \( 4.1 \)
Now, area of the hall \( =(2 x+1) . x \mathrm{~m}^{2}=\left(2 x^{2}+x\right) \mathrm{m}^{2} \)
So, \( 2 x^{2}+x=300 \quad \) (Given)
Therefore, \( 2 x^{2}+x-300=0 \)
So, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation \( 2 x^{2}+x-300=0 \) which is a quadratic equation.

Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum and a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation of the form \( x^{2}-p x+q=0 . \) Greek mathematician Euclid developed a geometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology, are solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is often credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598-665) gave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form \( a x^{2}+b x=c \). Later,
\( 2020-21 \) QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 71
Sridharacharya (C.E. 1025 ) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula, (as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing the square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800 ) also studied quadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book 'Liber embadorum' published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of different quadratic equations.

In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding their roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life situations.
4.2 Quadratic Equations
A quadratic equation in the variable \( x \) is an equation of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \), where \( a, b, c \) are real numbers, \( a \neq 0 . \) For example, \( 2 x^{2}+x-300=0 \) is a quadratic equation. Similarly, \( 2 x^{2}-3 x+1=0,4 x-3 x^{2}+2=0 \) and \( 1-x^{2}+300=0 \) are also quadratic equations.

In fact, any equation of the form \( p(x)=0 \), where \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 2 , is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of \( p(x) \) in descending order of their degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \), \( a \neq 0 \) is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.

Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in different fields of mathematics. Let us consider a few examples.
Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:
(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124 . We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
(ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was \( ₹ 750 . \) We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
Solution :
(i) Let the number of marbles John had be \( x \). Then the number of marbles Jivanti had \( =45-x \) (Why?).
The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles \( =x-5 \)
The number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles \( =45-x-5 \)
\[
\begin{array}{l}
=40-x \\
2020-21
\end{array}
\] 72
MATHEMATIC
Therefore, their product \( =(x-5)(40-x) \)
\[
\begin{array}{l}
=40 x-x^{2}-200+5 x \\
=-x^{2}+45 x-200
\end{array}
\]
So, \( \quad-x^{2}+45 x-200=124 \quad \) (Given that product = 124)
\[
\text { i.e., } \quad-x^{2}+45 x-324=0
\]
\[
\text { i.e., } \quad x^{2}-45 x+324=0
\]
Therefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation
\[
x^{2}-45 x+324=0
\]
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
(ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be \( x \). Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day \( =55-x \)
So, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day \( =x(55-x) \) Therefore, \( \quad x(55-x)=750 \)
i.e., \( 55 x-x^{2}=750 \)
i.e., \( -x^{2}+55 x-750=0 \)
i.e.,
\[
x^{2}-55 x+750=0
\]
Therefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation
\[
x^{2}-55 x+750=0
\]
which is the required representation of the problem mathematically.
Example \( 2: \) Check whether the following are quadratic equations:
(i) \( (x-2)^{2}+1=2 x-3 \)
(ii) \( x(x+1)+8=(x+2)(x-2) \)
\[
\text { (iii) } x(2 x+3)=x^{2}+1
\]
(iv) \( (x+2)^{3}=x^{3}-4 \)
Solution :
(i) LHS \( =(x-2)^{2}+1=x^{2}-4 x+4+1=x^{2}-4 x+5 \)
Therefore, \( (x-2)^{2}+1=2 x-3 \) can be rewritten as
\[
x^{2}-4 x+5=2 x-3
\]
i.e., \( x^{2}-6 x+8=0 \)
It is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \).
Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
\[
2020-21
\] QUADRATIC E\rhoUATIONS
(ii) Since \( x(x+1)+8=x^{2}+x+8 \) and \( (x+2)(x-2)=x^{2}-4 \) Therefore,
\[
x^{2}+x+8=x^{2}-4
\]
i.e.,
\[
x+12=0
\]
It is not of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \).
Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation.
(iii) Here, LHS \( =x(2 x+3)=2 x^{2}+3 x \)
So, \( x(2 x+3)=x^{2}+1 \) can be rewritten as
\[
2 x^{2}+3 x=x^{2}+1
\]
Therefore, we get \( \quad x^{2}+3 x-1=0 \) It is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \).
So, the given equation is a quadratic equation.
(iv) Here, LHS \( =(x+2)^{3}=x^{3}+6 x^{2}+12 x+8 \)
Therefore, \( (x+2)^{3}=x^{3}-4 \) can be rewritten as
\[
x^{3}+6 x^{2}+12 x+8=x^{3}-4
\]
i.e., \( 6 x^{2}+12 x+12=0 \) or, \( x^{2}+2 x+2=0 \)
It is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \). So, the given equation is a quadratic equation. Remark : Be careful! In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic equation, but it is not a quadratic equation.

In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of degree 3 ) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As you can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it is quadratic or not.

(i) \( (x+1)^{2}=2(x-3) \)
(ii) \( x^{2}-2 x=(-2)(3-x) \)

(iv) \( (x-3)(2 x+1)=x(x+5) \)
(v) \( (2 x-1)(x-3)=(x+5)(x-1) \)

(iii) Rohan's mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years) 3 years from now will be 360 . We would like to find Rohan's present age.
(iv) A train travels a distance of \( 480 \mathrm{~km} \) at a uniform speed. If the speed had been \( 8 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \) less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We need to find the speed of the train.
4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation Consider the quadratic equation \( 2 x^{2}-3 x+1=0 \). If we replace \( x \) by 1 on the LHS of this equation, we get \( \left(2 \times 1^{2}\right)-(3 \times 1)+1=0=\mathrm{RHS} \) of the equation. We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation \( 2 x^{2}-3 x+1=0 \). This also means that 1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial \( 2 x^{2}-3 x+1 \).

In general, a real number \( \alpha \) is called a root of the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0, a \neq 0 \) if \( a \alpha^{2}+b \alpha+c=0 \). We also say that \( x=\alpha \) is a solution of the quadratic equation, or that \( \alpha \) satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial \( a x^{2}+b x+c \) and the roots of the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are the same

You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most two zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots.

You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting their middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic equation. Let us see how.
Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \), by factorisation. Solution : Let us first split the middle term \( -5 x \) as \( -2 x-3 x \) [because \( (-2 x) \times(-3 x)= \) \( \left.6 x^{2}=\left(2 x^{2}\right) \times 3\right] \)
So, \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=2 x^{2}-2 x-3 x+3=2 x(x-1)-3(x-1)=(2 x-3)(x-1) \)
Now, \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) can be rewritten as \( (2 x-3)(x-1)=0 \).
So, the values of \( x \) for which \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) are the same for which \( (2 x-3)(x-1)=0 \),
i.e., either \( 2 x-3=0 \) or \( x-1=0 \). Now, \( 2 x-3=0 \) gives \( x=\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x-1=0 \) gives \( x=1 \). So, \( x=\frac{3}{2} \) and \( x=1 \) are the solutions of the equation. In other words, 1 and \( \frac{3}{2} \) are the roots of the equation \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \). Verify that these are the roots of the given equation.
\( 2020-21 \) QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
Note that we have found the roots of \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) by factorising \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3 \) into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero.
Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation \( 6 x^{2}-x-2=0 \). Solution: We have
\[
\begin{aligned}
6 x^{2}-x-2 &=6 x^{2}+3 x-4 x-2 \\
&=3 x(2 x+1)-2(2 x+1) \\
&=(3 x-2)(2 x+1)
\end{aligned}
\]
The roots of \( 6 x^{2}-x-2=0 \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( (3 x-2)(2 x+1)=0 \)
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text { Therefore, } 3 x-2=0 \text { or } 2 x+1=0 \\
\text { i.e., } \quad x=\frac{2}{3} \quad \text { or } \quad x=-\frac{1}{2}
\end{array}
\]
Therefore, the roots of \( 6 x^{2}-x-2=0 \) are \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( -\frac{1}{2} \).
We verify the roots, by checking that \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( -\frac{1}{2} \) satisfy \( 6 x^{2}-x-2=0 \).
Example 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation \( 3 x^{2}-2 \sqrt{6} x+2=0 \).
\[
\text { Solution : } \begin{aligned}
3 x^{2}-2 \sqrt{6} x+2 &=3 x^{2}-\sqrt{6} x-\sqrt{6} x+2 \\
&=\sqrt{3} x(\sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2})-\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2}) \\
&=(\sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2})
\end{aligned}
\]
So, the roots of the equation are the values of \( x \) for which
\[
(\sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2})=0
\]
Now, \( \sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2}=0 \) for \( x=\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \).
So, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor \( \sqrt{3} x-\sqrt{2} \).
Therefore, the roots of \( 3 x^{2}-2 \sqrt{6} x+2=0 \) are \( \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}, \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \).

MATHEMATICS
Example \( 6: \) Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1. Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is \( x \mathrm{~m} \), then \( x \) satisfies the equation \( 2 x^{2}+x-300=0 . \) Applying the factorisation method, we write this equation as
i.e.,
\[
\begin{array}{r}
2 x^{2}-24 x+25 x-300=0 \\
2 x(x-12)+25(x-12)=0 \\
(x-12)(2 x+25)=0
\end{array}
\]
So, the roots of the given equation are \( x=12 \) or \( x=-12.5 \). Since \( x \) is the breadth of the hall, it cannot be negative.
Thus, the breadth of the hall is \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \). Its length \( =2 x+1=25 \mathrm{~m} \).

It was observed on a particular day that the cost of production of each article (in rupees) was 3 more than twice the number of articles produced on that day. If the total cost of production on that day was \( ₹ 90 \), find the number of articles produced and the cost of each article.
4.4 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square
In the previous section, you have learnt one method of obtaining the roots of a quadratic equation. In this section, we shall study another method.
Consider the following situation:
The product of Sunita's age (in years) two years ago and her age four years from now is one more than twice her present age. What is her present age?

To answer this, let her present age (in years) be \( x . \) Then the product of her ages two years ago and four years from now is \( (x-2)(x+4) \).
\[
2020-21
\] QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
Therefore, \( (x-2)(x+4)=2 x+1 \)
i.e., \( x^{2}+2 x-8=2 x+1 \)
i.e.,
\[
x^{2}-9=0
\]
So, Sunita's present age satisfies the quadratic equation \( x^{2}-9=0 \).
We can write this as \( x^{2}=9 \). Taking square roots, we get \( x=3 \) or \( x=-3 \). Since the age is a positive number, \( x=3 \).
So, Sunita's present age is 3 years.
Now consider the quadratic equation \( (x+2)^{2}-9=0 . \) To solve it, we can write it as \( (x+2)^{2}=9 \). Taking square roots, we get \( x+2=3 \) or \( x+2=-3 \).
Therefore, \( x=1 \quad \) or \( \quad x=-5 \)
So, the roots of the equation \( (x+2)^{2}-9=0 \) are 1 and \( -5 \).
In both the examples above, the term containing \( x \) is completely inside a square, and we found the roots easily by taking the square roots. But, what happens if we are asked to solve the equation \( x^{2}+4 x-5=0 ? \) We would probably apply factorisation to do so, unless we realise (somehow!) that \( x^{2}+4 x-5=(x+2)^{2}-9 \).

So, solving \( x^{2}+4 x-5=0 \) is equivalent to solving \( (x+2)^{2}-9=0 \), which we have seen is very quick to do. In fact, we can convert any quadratic equation to the form \( (x+a)^{2}-b^{2}=0 \) and then we can easily find its roots. Let us see if this is possible. Look at Fig. 4.2.
In this figure, we can see how \( x^{2}+4 x \) is being converted to \( (x+2)^{2}-4 \).

MATHEMATIC
The process is as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
x^{2}+4 x &=\left(x^{2}+\frac{4}{2} x\right)+\frac{4}{2} x \\
&=x^{2}+2 x+2 x \\
&=(x+2) x+2 \times x \\
&=(x+2) x+2 \times x+2 \times 2-2 \times 2 \\
&=(x+2) x+(x+2) \times 2-2 \times 2 \\
&=(x+2)(x+2)-2^{2} \\
&=(x+2)^{2}-4 \\
\text { So, } x^{2}+4 x-5 &=(x+2)^{2}-4-5=(x+2)^{2}-9
\end{aligned}
\]
So, \( x^{2}+4 x-5=0 \) can be written as \( (x+2)^{2}-9=0 \) by this process of completing the square. This is known as the method of completing the square. In brief, this can be shown as follows:
\[
x^{2}+4 x=\left(x+\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}=\left(x+\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}-4
\]
So, \( x^{2}+4 x-5=0 \) can be rewritten as
\[
\left(x+\frac{4}{2}\right)^{2}-4-5=0
\]
i.e., \( (x+2)^{2}-9=0 \)
Consider now the equation \( 3 x^{2}-5 x+2=0 \). Note that the coefficient of \( x^{2} \) is not a perfect square. So, we multiply the equation throughout by 3 to get
\( 9 x^{2}-15 x+6=0 \)
Now,
\[
\begin{aligned}
9 x^{2}-15 x+6 &=(3 x)^{2}-2 \times 3 x \times \frac{5}{2}+6 \\
&=(3 x)^{2}-2 \times 3 x \times \frac{5}{2}+\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}+6 \\
&=\left(3 x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{25}{4}+6=\left(3 x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{4} \\
2020-21
\end{aligned}
\] QuADRATIC EQUATIONS
So, \( 9 x^{2}-15 x+6=0 \) can be written as
i.e.,
\[
\begin{array}{r}
\left(3 x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{4}=0 \\
\left(3 x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{4}
\end{array}
\]
So, the solutions of \( 9 x^{2}-15 x+6=0 \) are the same as those of \( \left(3 x-\frac{5}{2}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{4} \).
i.e.,
\[
3 x-\frac{5}{2}=\frac{1}{2} \text { or } 3 x-\frac{5}{2}=-\frac{1}{2}
\]
(We can also write this as \( 3 x-\frac{5}{2}=\pm \frac{1}{2} \), where ' \( \pm \) ' denotes 'plus minus'.)
Thus,
\[
3 x=\frac{5}{2}+\frac{1}{2} \text { or } 3 x=\frac{5}{2}-\frac{1}{2}
\]
So, \( x=\frac{5}{6}+\frac{1}{6} \) or \( x=\frac{5}{6}-\frac{1}{6} \)
Therefore, \( x=1 \) or \( x=\frac{4}{6} \)
i.e., \( x=1 \) or \( x=\frac{2}{3} \)
Therefore, the roots of the given equation are 1 and \( \frac{2}{3} \).
Remark : Another way of showing this process is as follows:
The equation \( 3 x^{2}-5 x+2=0 \)
is the same as
\[
x^{2}-\frac{5}{3} x+\frac{2}{3}=0
\]
Now, \( x^{2}-\frac{5}{3} x+\frac{2}{3}=\left\{x-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)\right\}^{2}-\left\{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)\right\}^{2}+\frac{2}{3} \)
\( 2020-21 \) 80
MATHEMATIC
\[
\begin{array}{l}
=\left(x-\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}+\frac{2}{3}-\frac{25}{36} \\
=\left(x-\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{36}=\left(x-\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{2}
\end{array}
\]
So, the solutions of \( 3 x^{2}-5 x+2=0 \) are the same as those of \( \left(x-\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{2}=0 \),
which are \( x-\frac{5}{6}=\pm \frac{1}{6} \), i.e., \( x=\frac{5}{6}+\frac{1}{6}=1 \) and \( x=\frac{5}{6}-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{2}{3} \).
Let us consider some examples to illustrate the above process.
Example 7 : Solve the equation given in Example 3 by the method of completing the square.
Solution: The equation \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) is the same as \( x^{2}-\frac{5}{2} x+\frac{3}{2}=0 \).
Now,
\[
x^{2}-\frac{5}{2} x+\frac{3}{2}=\left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}+\frac{3}{2}=\left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{16}
\]
Therefore, \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) can be written as \( \left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{16}=0 \).
So, the roots of the equation \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) are exactly the same as those of \( \left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{16}=0 . \) Now, \( \left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{16}=0 \) is the same as \( \left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{16} \)
Therefore,
\[
x-\frac{5}{4}=\pm \frac{1}{4}
\]
i.e.
\[
x=\frac{5}{4} \pm \frac{1}{4}
\]
i.e.,
\[
x=\frac{5}{4}+\frac{1}{4} \text { or } x=\frac{5}{4}-\frac{1}{4}
\]
i.e.,
\[
x=\frac{3}{2} \text { or } x=1
\]

\] QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
Therefore, the solutions of the equations are \( x=\frac{3}{2} \) and 1 . Let us verify our solutions.
Putting \( x=\frac{3}{2} \) in \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \), we get \( 2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{2}-5\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)+3=0 \), which is correct. Similarly, you can verify that \( x=1 \) also satisfies the given equation.

In Example 7 , we divided the equation \( 2 x^{2}-5 x+3=0 \) throughout by 2 to get \( x^{2}-\frac{5}{2} x+\frac{3}{2}=0 \) to make the first term a perfect square and then completed the square. Instead, we can multiply throughout by 2 to make the first term as \( 4 x^{2}=(2 x)^{2} \) and then complete the square. This method is illustrated in the next example.
Example 8 : Find the roots of the equation \( 5 x^{2}-6 x-2=0 \) by the method of completing the square. Solution : Multiplying the equation throughout by 5 , we get
\[
25 x^{2}-30 x-10=0
\]
This is the same as
\[
(5 x)^{2}-2 \times(5 x) \times 3+3^{2}-3^{2}-10=0
\]
i.e. \( (5 x-3)^{2}-9-10=0 \)
i.e., \( (5 x-3)^{2}-19=0 \)
i.e., \( (5 x-3)^{2}=19 \)
i.e., \( 5 x-3=\pm \sqrt{19} \)
i.e., \( 5 x=3 \pm \sqrt{19} \)
So, \( x=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{19}}{5} \)
Therefore, the roots are \( \frac{3+\sqrt{19}}{5} \) and \( \frac{3-\sqrt{19}}{5} \).
Verify that the roots are \( \frac{3+\sqrt{19}}{5} \) and \( \frac{3-\sqrt{19}}{5} \).

Example \( 9: \) Find the roots of \( 4 x^{2}+3 x+5=0 \) by the method of completing the square.
Solution : Note that \( 4 x^{2}+3 x+5=0 \) is the same as
i.e.,
\[
\begin{array}{r}
(2 x)^{2}+2 \times(2 x) \times \frac{3}{4}+\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}+5=0 \\
\left(2 x+\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}-\frac{9}{16}+5=0
\end{array}
\]
i.e.,
\[
\left(2 x+\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}+\frac{71}{16}=0
\]
i.e.,
\[
\left(2 x+\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}=\frac{-71}{6}<0
\]
But \( \left(2 x+\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2} \) cannot be negative for any real value of \( x \) (Why?). So, there is no real value of \( x \) satisfying the given equation. Therefore, the given equation has no real roots.

Now, you have seen several examples of the use of the method of completing the square. So, let us give this method in general.

Consider the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0(a \neq 0) \). Dividing throughout by
\( a \), we get
\[
x^{2}+\frac{b}{a} x+\frac{c}{a}=0
\]
This is the same as \( \quad\left(x+\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}+\frac{c}{a}=0 \)
i.e., \( \left(x+\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}-\frac{b^{2}-4 a c}{4 a^{2}}=0 \)
So, the roots of the given equation are the same as those of
\( \left(x+\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}-\frac{b^{2}-4 a c}{4 a^{2}}=0 \), i.e., those of \( \left(x+\frac{b}{2 a}\right)^{2}=\frac{b^{2}-4 a c}{4 a^{2}} \)
2020-21 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS
If \( b^{2}-4 a c \geq 0 \), then by taking the square roots in (1), we get
Therefore,
\[
\begin{aligned}
x+\frac{b}{2 a} &=\frac{\pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \\
x &=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}
\end{aligned}
\]
So, the roots of \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are \( \frac{-b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \) and \( \frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \), if \( b^{2}-4 a c \geq 0 \). If \( b^{2}-4 a c<0 \), the equation will have no real roots. (Why?)

Thus, if \( b^{2}-4 a c \geq 0 \), then the roots of the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are given by \( \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \)
This formula for finding the roots of a quadratic equation is known as the quadratic formula.

Let us consider some examples for illustrating the use of the quadratic formula.
Example 10 : Solve Q. 2(i) of Exercise \( 4.1 \) by using the quadratic formula.

Solution : Let the breadth of the plot be \( x \) metres. Then the length is \( (2 x+1) \) metres. Then we are given that \( x(2 x+1)=528 \), i.e., \( 2 x^{2}+x-528=0 \). This is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \), where \( a=2, b=1, c=-528 \).
So, the quadratic formula gives us the solution as
\[
x=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+4(2)(528)}}{4}=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{4225}}{4}=\frac{-1 \pm 65}{4}
\]
i.e., \( x=\frac{64}{4} \) or \( x=\frac{-66}{4} \)
i.e.,
\[
x=16 \text { or } x=-\frac{33}{2}
\]
Since \( x \) cannot be negative, being a dimension, the breadth of the plot is 16 metres and hence, the length of the plot is \( 33 \mathrm{~m} \).
You should verify that these values satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Example 11 : Find two consecutive odd positive integers, sum of whose squares is 290 .

Solution : Let the smaller of the two consecutive odd positive integers be \( x \). Then, the second integer will be \( x+2 \). According to the question,
\[
x^{2}+(x+2)^{2}=290
\]
i.e., \( x^{2}+x^{2}+4 x+4=290 \)
i.e.
\[
2 x^{2}+4 x-286=0
\]
i.e., \( x^{2}+2 x-143=0 \)
which is a quadratic equation in \( x \).
Using the quadratic formula, we get
\[
x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4+572}}{2}=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}=\frac{-2 \pm 24}{2}
\]
i.e.,
\[
x=11 \text { or } x=-13
\]
But \( x \) is given to be an odd positive integer. Therefore, \( x \neq-13, x=11 \). Thus, the two consecutive odd integers are 11 and 13 .
\[
\text { Check : } 11^{2}+13^{2}=121+169=290 \text { . }

Example 12 : A rectangular park is to be designed whose breadth is \( 3 \mathrm{~m} \) less than its length. Its area is to be 4 square metres more than the area of a park that has already been made in the shape of an isosceles triangle with its base as the breadth of the rectangular park and of altitude \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \) (see Fig. 4.3). Find its length and breadth. Solution : Let the breadth of the rectangular park be \( x \mathrm{~m} \).
So, its length \( =(x+3) \mathrm{m} \). Therefore, the area of the rectangular park \( =x(x+3) \mathrm{m}^{2}=\left(x^{2}+3\right. \). Now, base of the isosceles triangle \( =x \mathrm{~m} \).
Therefore, its area \( =\frac{1}{2} \times x \times 12=6 x \mathrm{~m}^{2} \)
According to our requirements, \( x^{2}+3 x=6 x+4 \)
i.e., \( x^{2}-3 x-4=0 \)

So, the breadth of the park \( =4 \mathrm{~m} \) and its length will be \( 7 \mathrm{~m} \).
Verification : Area of rectangular park \( =28 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \),
area of triangular park \( =24 \mathrm{~m}^{2}=(28-4) \mathrm{m}^{2} \)
Example 13 : Find the roots of the following quadratic equations, if they exist, using the quadratic formula:
\[
\text { (i) } 3 x^{2}-5 x+2=0

(ii) \( x^{2}+4 x+5=0 \)
(iii) \( 2 x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x+1=0 \)
Solution :
\[
\text { (i) } 3 x^{2}-5 x+2=0 \text { . Here, } a=3, b=-5, c=2 \text { . So, } b^{2}-4 a c=25-24=1>0 \text { . }
\]
Therefore, \( x=\frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{6}=\frac{5 \pm 1}{6} \), i.e., \( x=1 \) or \( x=\frac{2}{3} \)
So, the roots are \( \frac{2}{3} \) and 1 .
(ii) \( x^{2}+4 x+5=0 \). Here, \( a=1, b=4, c=5 \). So, \( b^{2}-4 a c=16-20=-4<0 \).
Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, therefore \( \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c} \) will
not have any real value.
So, there are no real roots for the given equation.
(iii) \( 2 x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x+1=0 \). Here, \( a=2, b=-2 \sqrt{2}, c=1 \).
So, \( \quad b^{2}-4 a c=8-8=0 \)
Therefore, \( x=\frac{2 \sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{0}}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \pm 0 \), i.e., \( x=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
So, the roots are \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

(ii) \( \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x-2}=3, x \neq 0,2 \)
Solution :
(i) \( x+\frac{1}{x}=3 \). Multiplying throughout by \( x \), we get
\[
x^{2}+1=3 x
\]
i.e., \( x^{2}-3 x+1=0 \), which is a quadratic equation.
Here, \( a=1, b=-3, c=1 \)
So,
\[
b^{2}-4 a c=9-4=5>0
\]
Therefore,
\[
x=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text { (Why?) }
\]
So, the roots are \( \frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2} \).
(ii) \( \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x-2}=3, x \neq 0,2 \).
As \( x \neq 0,2 \), multiplying the equation by \( x(x-2) \), we get
\[
\begin{aligned}
(x-2)-x &=3 x(x-2) \\
&=3 x^{2}-6 x
\end{aligned}
\]
So, the given equation reduces to \( 3 x^{2}-6 x+2=0 \), which is a quadratic equation.
Here,
\[
a=3, b=-6, c=2 . \quad \text { So, } b^{2}-4 a c=36-24=12>0
\]
Therefore,
\[
x=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{6}=\frac{6 \pm 2 \sqrt{3}}{6}=\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{3}}{3} \text { . }
\]
So, the roots are \( \frac{3+\sqrt{3}}{3} \) and \( \frac{3-\sqrt{3}}{3} \).

Solution : Let the speed of the stream be \( x \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \).
Therefore, the speed of the boat upstream \( =(18-x) \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \) and the speed of the boat downstream \( =(18+x) \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h} \).
The time taken to go upstream \( =\frac{\text { distance }}{\text { speed }}=\frac{24}{18-x} \) hours.
Similarly, the time taken to go downstream \( =\frac{24}{18+x} \) hours. According to the question,
i.e.,
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{24}{18-x}-\frac{24}{18+x}=1 \\
24(18+x)-24(18-x)=(18-x)(18+x)
\end{array}
\]
i.e.,
\[
x^{2}+48 x-324=0
\]
Using the quadratic formula, we get
\[
\begin{aligned}
x &=\frac{-48 \pm \sqrt{48^{2}+1296}}{2}=\frac{-48 \pm \sqrt{3600}}{2} \\
&=\frac{-48 \pm 60}{2}=6 \mathrm{or}-54
\end{aligned}
\]
Since \( x \) is the speed of the stream, it cannot be negative. So, we ignore the root \( x=-54 \). Therefore, \( x=6 \) gives the speed of the stream as \( 6 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \).

4.5 Nature of Roots
In the previous section, you have seen that the roots of the equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are given by
\[
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}
\]
If \( b^{2}-4 a c>0 \), we get two distinct real roots \( -\frac{b}{2 a}+\frac{\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \) and \( -\frac{b}{2 a}-\frac{\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} . \)
\[
2020-21
\] QuADRATIC EQUATIONS
If \( b^{2}-4 a c=0 \), then \( x=-\frac{b}{2 a} \pm 0 \), i.e., \( x=-\frac{b}{2 a} \) or \( -\frac{b}{2 a} \).
So, the roots of the equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are both \( \frac{-b}{2 a} \).
Therefore, we say that the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) has two equal real roots in this case.

If \( b^{2}-4 a c<0 \), then there is no real number whose square is \( b^{2}-4 a c \). Therefore, there are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case.

Since \( b^{2}-4 a c \) determines whether the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) has real roots or not, \( b^{2}-4 a c \) is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation.
So, a quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) has
(i) two distinct real roots, if \( b^{2}-4 a c>0 \),
(ii) two equal real roots, if \( b^{2}-4 a c=0 \),
(iii) no real roots, if \( b^{2}-4 a c<0 \).
Let us consider some examples.
Example 16 : Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation \( 2 x^{2}-4 x+3=0 \), and hence find the nature of its roots.

Solution : The given equation is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \), where \( a=2, b=-4 \) and \( c=3 \). Therefore, the discriminant \( b^{2}-4 a c=(-4)^{2}-(4 \times 2 \times 3)=16-24=-8<0 \)
So, the given equation has no real roots.
Example 17 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of diameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected?
Solution : Let us first draw the diagram (see Fig. 4.4).

Let \( \mathrm{P} \) be the required location of the pole. Let the distance of the pole from the gate \( \mathrm{B} \) be \( x \mathrm{~m} \), i.e., \( \mathrm{BP}=x \mathrm{~m} \). Now the difference of the distances of the pole from the two gates \( =\mathrm{AP}-\mathrm{BP}( \) or, \( \mathrm{BP}-\mathrm{AP})= \)
\( 7 \mathrm{~m} \). Therefore, \( \mathrm{AP}=(x+7) \mathrm{m} \).
Fig. \( 4.4 \)
\( 2020-21 \) 90
Now, \( \mathrm{AB}=13 \mathrm{~m} \), and since \( \mathrm{AB} \) is a diameter,
\[
\angle \mathrm{APB}=90^{\circ} \quad \text { (Why?) }
\]
Therefore, \( \quad \mathrm{AP}^{2}+\mathrm{PB}^{2}=\mathrm{AB}^{2} \quad \) (By Pythagoras theorem)
i.e., \( (x+7)^{2}+x^{2}=13^{2} \)
i.e.,
\[
x^{2}+14 x+49+x^{2}=169
\]
i.e.,
\[
2 x^{2}+14 x-120=0
\]
So, the distance ' \( x \) ' of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation
\[
x^{2}+7 x-60=0
\]
So, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this is so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is
\[
b^{2}-4 a c=7^{2}-4 \times 1 \times(-60)=289>0 .
\]
So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the pole on the boundary of the park.

Solving the quadratic equation \( x^{2}+7 x-60=0 \), by the quadratic formula, we get
\[
x=\frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{289}}{2}=\frac{-7 \pm 17}{2}
\]
Therefore, \( x=5 \) or \( -12 \).
Since \( x \) is the distance between the pole and the gate \( \mathrm{B} \), it must be positive. Therefore, \( x=-12 \) will have to be ignored. So, \( x=5 \).

Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of \( 5 \mathrm{~m} \) from the gate \( \mathrm{B} \) and \( 12 \mathrm{~m} \) from the gate \( \mathrm{A} \).

Example 18 : Find the discriminant of the equation \( 3 x^{2}-2 x+\frac{1}{3}=0 \) and hence find the nature of its roots. Find them, if they are real.
Solution: Here \( a=3, b=-2 \) and \( c=\frac{1}{3} \).
Therefore, discriminant \( b^{2}-4 a c=(-2)^{2}-4 \times 3 \times \frac{1}{3}=4-4=0 \).
Hence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots.
The roots are \( \frac{-b}{2 a}, \frac{-b}{2 a} \), i.e., \( \frac{2}{6}, \frac{2}{6} \), i.e., \( \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3} \).

4.6 Summary In this chapter, you have studied the following points:
1. A quadratic equation in the variable \( x \) is of the form \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \), where \( a, b, c \) are real numbers and \( a \neq 0 \).
2. A real number \( \alpha \) is said to be a root of the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \), if \( a \alpha^{2}+b \alpha+c=0 \). The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial \( a x^{2}+b x+c \) and the roots of the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are the same.
3. If we can factorise \( a x^{2}+b x+c, a \neq 0 \), into a product of two linear factors, then the roots of the quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) can be found by equating each factor to zero.
4. A quadratic equation can also be solved by the method of completing the square.
5. Quadratic formula: The roots of a quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) are given by \( \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \), provided \( b^{2}-4 a c \geq 0 . \)
6. A quadratic equation \( a x^{2}+b x+c=0 \) has
(i) two distinct real roots, if \( b^{2}-4 a c>0 \),
(ii) two equal roots (i.e., coincident roots), if \( b^{2}-4 a c=0 \), and
(iii) no real roots, if \( b^{2}-4 a c<0 \).
