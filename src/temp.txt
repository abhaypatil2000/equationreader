 +  p(x)  is a polynomial in  x , the highest power of  x  in  p(x)  is called the degree of the polynomial  p(x) . For example,  4 x+2  is a polynomial in the variable  x  of degree  1,2 y to the power 2-3 y+4  is a polynomial in the variable  y  of degree  2,5 x to the power 3-4 x to the power 2+x- square root of 2 
is a polynomial in the variable  x  of degree 3 and  7 u to the power 6-3 by 2 u to the power 4+4 u to the power 2+u-8  is a polynomial
in the variable  u  of degree 6. Expressions like  equation start 1 by x-1,  square root of x+2, 1 by x to the power 2+2 x+3  equation end  etc., are not polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example,  2 x-3 ,  equation start  square root of 3 x+5, y+ square root of 2, x-2 by 11, 3 z+4, 2 by 3 u+1  equation end , etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials such as  2 x+5-x to the power 2, x to the power 3+1 , etc., are not linear polynomials.

A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name 'quadratic'
has been derived from the word 'quadrate', which means 'square'.  2 x to the power 2+3 x-2 by 5 ,
 equation start y to the power 2-2,2-x to the power 2+ square root of 3 x, u by 3-2 u to the power 2+5,  square root of 5 v to the power 2-2 by 3 v, 4 z to the power 2+1 by 7  equation end  are some examples of
quadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any quadratic polynomial in  x  is of the form  a x to the power 2+b x+c , where  a, b, c  are real numbers and  a  not equal to  0 . A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of

a cubic polynomial are  2-x to the power 3, x to the power 3,  square root of 2 x to the power 3, 3-x to the power 2+x to the power 3, 3 x to the power 3-2 x to the power 2+x-1 . In fact, the most general form of a cubic polynomial is
new row
a x to the power 3+b x to the power 2+c x+d

where,  a, b, c, d  are real numbers and  a  not equal to  0 . Now consider the polynomial  p(x)=x to the power 2-3 x-4 .  Then, putting  x=2  in the polynomial, we get  p(2)=2 to the power 2-3  times  2-4=-6 . The value '  -6  ', obtained by replacing  x  by 2 in  x to the power 2-3 x-4 , is the value of  x to the power 2-3 x-4  at  x=2 . Similarly,  p(0)  is the value of  p(x)  at  x=0 , which is  -4 .

If  p(x)  is a polynomial in  x , and if  k  is any real number, then the value obtained by replacing  x  by  k  in  p(x) , is called the value of  p(x)  at  x=k , and is denoted by  p(k) . What is the value of  p(x)=x to the power 2-3 x-4  at  x=-1  ? We have :
new row
p(-1)=(-1) to the power 2- times (-1)
Also, note that  .
As  p(-1)=0  and  p(4)=0,-1  and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial  x to the power 2-3 x-4 . More generally, a real number  k  is said to be a zero of a polynomial  , if  p(k)=0 .

You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear polynomial. For example, if  k  is a zero of  p(x)=2 x+3 , then  p(k)=0  gives us
new row
2 k+3=0  , i.e.,  k=-3 by 2  . 

In general, if  k  is a zero of  p(x)=a x+b , then  p(k)=a k+b=0 , i.e.,  k=-b by a . So, the zero of the linear polynomial  a x+b  is  equation start -b by a=-( Constant term ) by  Coefficient of  x  equation end .

Thus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this happen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial also related to its coefficients?

In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the division algorithm for polynomials.
2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial
You know that a real number  k  is a zero of the polynomial  p(x)  if  p(k)=0 . But why are the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the geometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical meaning of their zeroes.

MATHEMATICS
Consider first a linear polynomial  a x+b, a  not equal to  0 . You have studied in Class IX that the graph of  y=a x+b  is a straight line. For example, the graph of  y=2 x+3  is a straight line passing through the points  (-2,-1)  and  (2,7) .
table begins first row  x   next column   -2   next column  2  next row  y=2 x+3   next column   -1   next column  7  table ended 
From Fig. 2.1, you can see that the graph of  y=2 x+3  intersects the  x  -axis mid-way between  x=-1  and
that is, at the point  (-3 by 2, 0) .
You also know that the zero of
 2 x+3  is  -3 by 2 . Thus, the zero of the polynomial  2 x+3  is the  x  -coordinate of the point where the graph of  y=2 x+3  intersects the Fig.
 x  -axis.
In general, for a linear polynomial  a x+b, a  not equal to  0 , the graph of  y=a x+b  is a
straight line which intersects the  x  -axis at exactly one point, namely,  (-b by a, 0) .
Therefore, the linear polynomial  a x+b, a  not equal to  0 , has exactly one zero, namely, the  x  -coordinate of the point where the graph of  y=a x+b  intersects the  x  -axis.

Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial  x to the power 2-3 x-4 . Let us see what the graph* of  y=x to the power 2-3 x-4  looks like. Let us list a few values of  y=x to the power 2-3 x-4  corresponding to a few values for  x  as given in Table  2.1 .

Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students, nor is to be evaluated.

If we locate the points listed
the points where the graph of  y=x to the power 2-3 x-4  intersects
the  x  -axis.
This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic polynomial  a x to the power 2+b x+c, a  not equal to  0 , are precisely the  x  -coordinates of the points where the parabola representing  y=a x to the power 2+b x+c  intersects the  x  -axis.

From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of  y=a x to the power 2+b x+c , the following three cases can happen:
2020-21 24
МАТнЕ
Case (i) : Here, the graph cuts  x  -axis at two distinct points A and A'.
The  x  -coordinates of  A  and  A to the power   are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial  a x to the power 2+b x+c  in this case (see Fig. 2.3).
 2 . 3 
Case (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the  x  -axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident points. So, the two points A and  A to the power   of Case (i) coincide here to become one point  A  (see Fig. 2.4).
(i)
(ii)
Fig.  2.4 
The  x  -coordinate of  A  is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial  a x to the power 2+b x+c  in this case.
2020-21 PoLYNOMIALS
Case (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the  x  -axis or completely below the  x  -axis. So, it does not cut the  x  -axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5).
(i)
(ii)
Fig.  2.5 
So, the quadratic polynomial  a x to the power 2+b x+c  has no zero in this case.
So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two distinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a polynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes.

Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic polynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial  x to the power 3-4 x . To see what the graph of  y=x to the power 3-4 x  looks like, let us list a few values of  y  corresponding to a few values for  x  as shown in Table  2.2 .
Table  2.2 
table begins first row  x   next column   -2   next column   -1   next column  0  next column  1  next column  2  next row  y=x to the power 3-4 x   next column  0  next column  3  next column  0  next column   -3   next column  0  table ended 
Locating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see that the graph of  y=x to the power 3-4 x  actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6.
2020-21 We see from the table above
0 and 2 are zeroes of the
cubic polynomial  x to the power 3-4 x . Observe
that  -2,0  and 2 are, in fact, the
 x  -coordinates of the only points graph of  y=x to the power 3-4 x 
 x  -axis. Since the curve eets the  x  -axis in only these 3
points, their  x  -coordinates are the only zeroes of the polynomial.
Let us take a few more
examples. Consider the cubic polynomials  x to the power 3  and  x to the power 3-x to the power 2 . We draw the graphs of  y=x to the power 3  and  y=x to the power 3-x to the power 2  in Fig.  2.7  and Fig.  2.8  respectively. Fig.  2.6

Note that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial  x to the power 3 . Also, from Fig.  2.7 , you can see that 0 is the  x  -coordinate of the only point where the graph of  y=x to the power 3  intersects the  x  -axis. Similarly, since  x to the power 3-x to the power 2=x to the power 2(x-1), 0  and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial  x to the power 3-x to the power 2 .  Also, from Fig.  2.8 , these values are the  x  -coordinates of the only points where the graph of  y=x to the power 3-x to the power 2  intersects the  x  -axis.

From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic polynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes.
Remark : In general, given a polynomial  p(x)  of degree  n , the graph of  y=p(x)  intersects the  x  -axis at atmost  n  points. Therefore, a polynomial  p(x)  of degree  n  has at most  n  zeroes.

Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig.  2.9  given below. Each is the graph of  y=p(x) , where  p(x)  is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of  p(x) .

Solution:

(ii) The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the  x  -axis at two points.

2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial You have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial  a x+b  is  -b by a . We will now try to answer the question raised in Section  2.1  regarding the relationship between zeroes and coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial, say  p(x)=2 x to the power 2-8 x+6 . In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term  '-8 x to the power   as a sum of two terms, whose product is  6  times  2 x to the power 2=12 x to the power 2 .  So, we write
 2 x to the power 2-8 x+6=2 x to the power 2-6 x-2 x+6=2 x(x-3)-2(x-3) 
new row
=(2 x-2)(x-3)=2(x-1)(x-3)

 2020-21  POLYNOMIALS
So, the value of  p(x)=2 x to the power 2-8 x+6  is zero when  x-1=0  or  x-3=0 , i.e., when  x=1  or  x=3 . So, the zeroes of  2 x to the power 2-8 x+6  are 1 and 3 . Observe that :

Let us take one more quadratic polynomial, say,  p(x)=3 x to the power 2+5 x-2 . By the method of splitting the middle term,
