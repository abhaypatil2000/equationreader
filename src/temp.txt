1.2 Properties of Rational Numbers
 equation start 1 . 2 . 1   Closure  
(i) Whole numbers
Let us revisit the closure property for all the operations on whole numbers in brief.
table begins first row  Operation  next column Numbers   next column Remarks   next row  Addition  next column   equation start 0+5=5,  equation end  a whole number  equation start 4+7= equation end  Is it a whole number? In general,  equation start a+b  equation end  is a whole number for any two whole numbers  equation start a  equation end  and  equation start b .  equation end   next column  Whole numbers are closed under addition.  next row  Subtraction  next column   equation start 5-7=-2,  equation end  which is not a whole number.  next column  Whole numbers are not closed under subtraction.  next row  Multiplication  next column   equation start 0  times  3=0,  equation end  a whole number  equation start 3  times  7= equation end  Is it a whole number? In general, if  equation start a  equation end  and  equation start b  equation end  are any two whole numbers, their product ab is a whole number.  next column  Whole numbers are closed under multiplication.  next row  Division  next column   equation start 5 divided by 8=5 by 8,  equation end  which is not a whole number.  next column  Whole numbers are not closed under division.  table ended 
Check for closure property under all the four operations for natural numbers.
(ii) Integers
Let us now recall the operations under which integers are closed. table begins first row  Operation  next column Numbers   next column Remarks   next row  Addition  next column   equation start -6+5=-1,  equation end  an integer Is  equation start -7+(-5)  equation end  an integer? Is  equation start 8+5  equation end  an integer?  next column  Integers are closed under addition.  equation start a+b  equation end  is an integer for any two integers  equation start a  equation end  and  equation start b .  equation end   next column   next row  Subtraction  next column   equation start 7-5=2  equation end  an integer  next column  Integers are closed under  equation start 5-7  equation end  an integer?  next column  subtraction.  equation start -6-8=-14,  equation end  an integer  next column   table ended
