HÃ´ar Equations in CHAPTER
One Variable

2.1 Introduction  
In the earlier classes, you have come across several algebraic expressions and equations.
Some examples of expressions we have so far worked with are
new row, 
5 x, 2 x-3,3 x+y, 2 x y+5, x y z+x+y+z, x to the power 2,+1, y+y to the power 2,

Some examples of equations are:  equation start, 5 x=25,2 x-3=9,2 y+5 by 2=37 by 2, 6 z+10=-2  equation end, 
You would remember that equations use the equality (=) sign; it is missing in expressions
Of these given expressions, many have more than one variable. For example,  2 x y+5  has two variables. We however, restrict to expressions with only one variable when we form equations. Moreover, the expressions we use to formequations are linear. This means that the highest power of the variable appearing in the expression is 1 . These are linear expressions:
new row, 
2 x, 2 x+1,3 y-7,12-5 z, 5 by 4(x-4)+10

These are not linear expressions:
 x to the power 2,+1, y+y to the power 2,, 1+z+z to the power 2,+z to the power 3,  (since highest power of variable  >1  )
Here we will deal with equations with linearexpressions in one variable only. Such equations are known as linear equations in one variable. The simple equations which you studied in the earlier classes were all of this type
Let us briefly revise what we know:
