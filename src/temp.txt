  right arrow (x-3)(x-2)=0  (replacing an expression by an equal/equivalent expression)   right arrow  x-3=0  or  x-2=0  (from the established theorem  a b=0  right arrow   either  a=0  or  b=0 , for  a, b  in 
  right arrow  x-3+3=0+3  or  x-2+2=0+2  (adding equal quantities on either side of the equation does not alter the nature of the equation)
  right arrow  x+0=3  or  x+0=2  (using the identity property of integers under addition)
  right arrow  x=3  or  x=2  (using the identity property of integers under addition)
Hence,  x to the power 2,-5 x+6=0  implies  x=3  or  x=2 
Explanation Let  p  be the given statement "  x to the power 2,-5 x+6=0  " and  q  be the conclusion statement "  x=3  or  x=2 " 

From the statement  p , we deduced the statement  r: to the power ,(x-3)(x-2)=0 " to the power , by  replacing the expression  x to the power 2,-5 x+6  in the statement  p  by another expression  (x-3)   (x-2)  which is equal to  x to the power 2,-5 x+6 
There arise two questions
(i) How does the expression  (x-3)(x-2)  is equal to the expression  x to the power 2,-5 x+6 ? 
(ii) How can we replace an expression with another expression which is equal to the former?
The first one is proved in earlier classes by factorization, i.e.  x to the power 2,-5 x+6=x to the power 2,-3 x-2 x+6=x(x-3)-2(x-3)=(x-3)(x-2) 
The second one is by valid form of argumentation (rules of logic)
Next this statement  r  becomes premises or given and deduce the statement  s   x-3=0  or  x-2=0  " and the reasons are given in the brackets. This process continues till we reach the conclusion.
The symbolic equivalent of the argument is to prove by deduction that  p  right arrow  q 
is true.
Starting with  p , we deduce  p  right arrow  r  right arrow  s  right arrow   right arrow  q .  This implies that "  p  right arrow  q  ' is true.
Example 2 Prove that the function  f: R arrow R 
defined by  f(x)=2 x+5  is one-one.
Solution Note that a function  f  is one-one if
 f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})  right arrow  x_{1}=x_{2}  (definition of one-one function)
Now, given that  (x_{1})=f(x_{2}) , i.e.,  2 x_{1}+5=2 x_{2}+5 
  right arrow  
 2 x_{1}+5-5=2 x_{2}+5-5  (adding the same quantity on both sides)
