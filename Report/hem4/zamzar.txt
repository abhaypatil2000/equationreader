                                              3  − 8
                                                 −   = ...                     Is it a rational number?

                         Try this for some more pairs of rational numbers. We find that rational numbers
                         are closed under subtraction. That is, for any two rational numbers a and
                         b, a – b is also a rational number.
                     (c) Let us now see the product of two rational numbers.
                                 −2 4  −8 3 2 6
                                   × =   ; × =                           (both the products are rational numbers)
                                  3 5  15 7 5 35
                             4 −6
                             −  ×     = ...                                      Is it a rational number?
                             5 11
                         Take some more pairs of rational numbers and check that their product is again
                         a rational number.
                         We say that rational numbers are closed under multiplication. That
                         is, for any two rational numbers a and b, a × b is also a rational
                         number.
                                       −5 2 − 25
                     (d) We note that       ÷ =                                       (a rational number)
                                        3 5          6
                          2 5                                  −3 − 2
                            ÷ = ... . Is it a rational number?   ÷     = ... . Is it a rational number?
                          7 3                                  8    9
                          Can you say that rational numbers are closed under division?
                          We find that for any rational number a, a ÷ 0 is not defined.
                          So rational numbers are not closed under division.
                          However, if we exclude zero then the collection of, all other rational numbers is
                          closed under division.
