\[
\frac{5}{8}-\frac{4}{5}=\frac{25-32}{40}=\ldots
\]
Is it a rational number?
\[
\frac{3}{7}-\left(\frac{-8}{5}\right)=\ldots
\]
Is it a rational number?
Try this for some more pairs of rational numbers. We find that rational numbers are closed under subtraction. That is, for any two rational numbers a and b, \( a-b \) is also a rational number.
(c) Let us now see the product of two rational numbers.
\( \frac{-2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5}=\frac{-8}{15} ; \frac{3}{7} \times \frac{2}{5}=\frac{6}{35} \quad \) (both the products are rational numbers)
\[
-\frac{4}{5} \times \frac{-6}{11}=\ldots
\]
Is it a rational number?
Take some more pairs of rational numbers and check that their product is again a rational number.

We say that rational numbers are closed under multiplication. That is, for any two rational numbers a and b, \( a \times b \) is also a rational number. (d) We note that \( \frac{-5}{3} \div \frac{2}{5}=\frac{-25}{6} \quad \) (a rational number)
\( \frac{2}{7} \div \frac{5}{3}=\ldots \). Is it a rational number? \( \frac{-3}{8} \div \frac{-2}{9}=\ldots . \) Is it a rational number?
Can you say that rational numbers are closed under division? We find that for any rational number \( a, a \div 0 \) is not defined. So rational numbers are not closed under division. However, if we exclude zero then the collection of, all other rational numbers is closed under division.
