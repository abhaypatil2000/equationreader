1.2 Properties of Rational Numbers
 1 . 2 . 1   Closure  
(i) Whole numbers
Let us revisit the closure property for all the operations on whole numbers in brief.
table begins first row  Operation  next column Numbers   next column Remarks   next row  Addition  next column   0+5=5,  a whole number  4+7= Is it a whole number? In general,  a+b  is a whole number for any two whole numbers  a  and  b .   next column  Whole numbers are closed under addition.  next row  Subtraction  next column   5-7=-2,  which is not a whole number.  next column  Whole numbers are not closed under subtraction.  next row  Multiplication  next column   0  times  3=0,  a whole number  3  times  7= Is it a whole number? In general, if  a  and  b  are any two whole numbers, their product ab is a whole number.  next column  Whole numbers are closed under multiplication.  next row  Division  next column   equation start 5 divided by 8=5 by 8,  equation end  which is not a whole number.  next column  Whole numbers are not closed under division.  table ended 
Check for closure property under all the four operations for natural numbers.
(ii) Integers
Let us now recall the operations under which integers are closed. table begins first row  Operation  next column Numbers   next column Remarks   next row  Addition  next column   -6+5=-1,  an integer Is  -7+(-5)  an integer? Is  8+5  an integer?  next column  Integers are closed under addition.  a+b  is an integer for any two integers  a  and  b .   next column   next row  Subtraction  next column   7-5=2  an integer  next column  Integers are closed under  5-7  an integer?  next column  subtraction.  -6-8=-14,  an integer  next column   table ended
